#  Sentiment Analysis using NLP  
A **graduation project** focused on analyzing text sentiment using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and Machine Learning.  

## Overview  
This project classifies text into **Positive, Neutral, or Negative** sentiments using different techniques, including **lexicon-based, deep learning, and transformer models**. The dataset used for this project is a collection of **Twitter tweets** obtained from **Kaggle**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python**   
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Machine Learning**  
- **Sentiment Analysis Models:**  
  - 🟢 **VADER** (Lexicon-based) – via NLTK  
  - 🔵 **TextCNN** (Deep Learning) – via Keras  
  - 🟣 **RoBERTa** (Transformer-based) – via Hugging Face Transformers  
- **Libraries:**  
  - **NLTK** – for text processing & VADER analysis  
  - **Keras** – for training the TextCNN model  
  - **Transformers (Hugging Face)** – for RoBERTa implementation  
  - **Pandas & NumPy** – for data preprocessing  
  - **Matplotlib.pyplot** – for data visualization  
  - **TQDM** – for tracking progress

 
 ## database
 This project uses a mental health-related social media dataset from Kaggle. It processes the sentiment of posts (tweets, for example) into one of two categories: Positive, or Negative.
 ```bash
 Input: "I'm feeling really low today and struggling to stay positive."
Output: "Negative sentiment"

Input: "I just got some great news! I'm so happy!"
Output: "Positive sentiment"
```


## 📦 Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/razanalqasim/Sentiment-Analysis-NLP.git  
cd Sentiment-Analysis-NLP  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python main.py
```
